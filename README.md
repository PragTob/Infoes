# Infoes
Infoes is a GUI client application that aims to get events into one timeline. So you see new RSS feeds alongside new Tweets. The name is intended to be little mixture of Information and Shoes (the GUI toolkit which this is build with) - so it's called Infoes!

# Know other cool services?
For now just support for RSS-Feeds and Twitter is planned (maybe Facebook) - but maybe I'll expand. If you got ideas please drop me a message or open an issue!

# Attention! Under development
infoes is totally under development and not even nearly ready to being used and I would strongly discourage from using it just now. However come and check back later!
